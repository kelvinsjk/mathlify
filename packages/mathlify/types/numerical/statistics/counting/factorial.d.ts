/**
 * A [Factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial), usually written n!, is the product of all positive
 * integers less than or equal to n. Often factorial is implemented
 * recursively, but this iterative approach is significantly faster
 * and simpler.
 *
 * @param {number} n input, must be an integer number 1 or greater
 * @returns {number} factorial: n!
 * @throws {Error} if n is less than 0 or not an integer
 * @example
 * factorial(5); // => 120
