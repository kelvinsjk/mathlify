I still remember being introduced to [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) around
a decade agp. It felt like
a game changer! I installed a [wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mathjax-latex/)
on my blog/website, and it worked like a charm. Beautiful math on the web has finally arrived!

## MathJax and KaTeX

[KaTeX](https://katex.org/) introduced a faster experience (with its different implementation approach),
and by adding a couple of lines of HTML (using the CDN version with the auto-render extension), we
can get math rendering on any static site.

With version 3 MathJax has seen significant speed improvements so I can see a case for either. KaTeX still
seems faster, while MathJax trades off some speed for slightly more features. As far as I know these two are
still the defacto libraries of choice for anyone interested in this area.

## Some good implementations

This post is dedicated to some of my favorite websites and web apps over the years that have done
it right, before I go on my rants on things that are still not ideal and pontificate on the different approaches
that I have explored in digitalizing math content.

It goes without saying that this is a non-exhaustive list
