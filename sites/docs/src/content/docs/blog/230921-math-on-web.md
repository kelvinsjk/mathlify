Displaying mathematical content on the web is still the Wild West in 2023.
Pdfs are great for printing, but downloading a pdf to read on a mobile device
is feeling incredibly ancient.

## Green shoots

A decade ago I was introduced to [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and it felt like
a game changer. I installed a [wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mathjax-latex/)
on my blog/website, and it worked like a charm. Beautiful math on the web has finally arrived!

[KaTeX](https://katex.org/) introduced a faster experience (with its different implementation approach),
and by adding a couple of lines of HTML (using the CDN version with the auto-render extension), we
can get math rendering on any static site.
