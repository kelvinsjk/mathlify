title: Describing sets of real numbers
---

We will often be working with sets of real numbers in this chapter. The
**set-builder notation** allows us to use inequalities to describe sets. For
example, $`\{ x \in \mathbb{R}: 0 < x \leq 1 \}` is used to describe the set of
real numbers between 0 (exclusive) and 1 (inclusive).

## The interval notation

The **interval notation** is often a more convenient way to describe these sets
of real number.

The previous example of $`\{ x \in \mathbb{R}: 0 < x \leq 1 \}` can be written
in interval notation as $`(0,1].` Round parenthesis, ( or ), are used to
indicate that the end value is not included while square brackets, [ or ], are
used to indicate that the end value is included.

## Examples

|           Inequality            |         Interval Notation         |
| :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
|            $`x < -3`            |         $`(-\infty, -3)`          |
|           $`x \leq 5`           |          $`(-\infty, 5]`          |
|          $`1 < x < 4`           |             $`(1, 4)`             |
|       $`1 \leq x \leq 4`        |             $`[1, 4]`             |
|         $`1 \leq x < 4`         |             $`[1, 4)`             |
|         $`1 < x \leq 4`         |             $`(1, 4]`             |
|           $`x \geq 2`           |          $`[2, \infty)`           |
|            $`x > 0`             |          $`(0, \infty)`           |
| $`x \in \mathbb{R}, {x \neq 7}` | $`(-\infty, 7) \cup (7, \infty)`  |
|    $`x \leq -1` or $`x > 3`     | $`(-\infty, -1] \cup (3, \infty)` |
|       $`x \in \mathbb{R}`       |       $`(-\infty, \infty)`        |
