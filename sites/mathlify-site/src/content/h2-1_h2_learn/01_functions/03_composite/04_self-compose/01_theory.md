title: Self composition
---

Just like we can compose two functions $`f` and $`g` to get $`fg,` we can also
compose a function with itself. We denote this function $`f^2 = ff` and this is
different from squaring the original function.

## Example

For example, if
$`{f(x) = 2x + 3,}` then
$`f^2(x) = ff(x) = {f(2x+3)} = {2(2x+3) + 3} = {4x + 9},`
which is not the same as $`{\big(f(x)\big)^2 = (2x+3)^2.}`

In a similar fashion to the existence of $`fg,` we also have that the composite
function $`f^2` exists if $`R_f \subseteq D_f.`

## A note about notation

We have just seen that
$`f^2(x)` stands for $`ff(x)` and is different from the
square of $`f` which we denote $`\big(f(x)\big)^2.` In a similar fashion, we
note that the previous section on inverse functions use the notation
$`f^{-1}(x)`
to denote the "reverse" and is different from the reciprocal
$`{\big(f(x)\big)^{-1} = \frac{1}{f(x)}.}`
