title: Self-inverse functions
---

## Definition

A special type of function is the **self-inverse** function: a function that is
its own inverse. That is, $`{f(x)=f^{-1}(x)}` for all $`x` in the domain of
$`f.`

For example, we can check that
$`{f(x)=x,}` $`{g(x)=-x}` and
$`{h(x)=\frac{1}{x}}` are all self-inverse
functions.

## Special results for self-inverse functions

In the previous sections saw that
$`{f^2(x) = ff(x)}` and $`{ff^{-1}(x) = x.}`
For self inverse functions, since $`{f=f^{-1},}` we have
$`f^2(x)=ff(x)=ff^{-1}(x)=x.`

The result that $`{f^2(x)=x}` is really powerful: it means that applying $`f`
twice has the same result of not doing anything. This allows us to simplify
cases where a function is composed many times.

For example, $`f^3(x)=ff^2(x)=f(x)` and $`f^4(x)=f^2f^2(x)=f^2(x)=x.` Are you
able to figure out what $`f^{314}(x)` and $`f^{999}(x)` are?
