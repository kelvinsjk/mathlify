## Asymptotes

The curve of ${y=\displaystyle a + \frac{b}{cx+d}}$
has a vertical asymptote $x=-\frac{c}{d}$
and a horizontal asymptote $y=a$.

## Rectangular hyperbolas

### Example

The curve of ${y=\displaystyle 3 + \frac{1}{x+2}}$
has a vertical asymptote $x=-2$ and a horizontal asymptote $y=3$.

We can then use a graphing calculator to sketch the curve, using our asymptotes
to better understand the shape of the curve.

Curves of this form are called rectangular hyperbolas, and appears frequently in our study.

## Improper rational functions

A rational function is considered _improper_ if the degree of the numerator is greater or equal to the degree of the denominator.

For example, ${y=\displaystyle \frac{3x+7}{x+2}}$ is improper because the degree of both the numerator and denominator is $1$.

### Long division

To find the asymptotes of an improper rational function, we can use **_long division_**.

${\displaystyle \frac{3x+7}{x+2}}$ can be rewritten as ${\displaystyle 3 + \frac{1}{x+2}}$
via long division. We can now use this form to deduce that the asymptotes are $x=-2$ and $y=3$.
