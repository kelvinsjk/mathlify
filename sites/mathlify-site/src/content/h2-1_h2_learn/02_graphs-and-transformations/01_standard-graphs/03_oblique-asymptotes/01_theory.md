In addition to horizontal and vertical asymptotes, we can also have _oblique_ (slanted) asymptotes.

## Asymptotes

The curve of ${y=\displaystyle ax+b + \frac{c}{dx+e}}$
has a vertical asymptote ${x=-\frac{e}{d}}$
and an **_oblique asymptote_** ${y=ax+b.}$

## Example

The curve of ${y=\displaystyle 3x+1 + \frac{2}{x-1}}$
has a vertical asymptote ${x=1}$ and an oblique asymptote ${y=3x+1.}$

## Long division

Similar to the previous section, long division can be used to find asymptotes (including oblique ones)
of improper rational functions.

For example, ${\displaystyle \frac{3x^2-2x+1}{x-2}}$ can be rewritten as ${\displaystyle 3x+1 + \frac{2}{x-1}}$
via long division. We can now use this form to deduce that the asymptotes are ${x=1}$ and ${y=3x+1.}$
