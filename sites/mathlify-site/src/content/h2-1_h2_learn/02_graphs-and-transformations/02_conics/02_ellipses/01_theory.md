## Equation of an ellipse

The equation of an ellipse, in standard form, is

$$ \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1. $$

## Drawing an ellipse

### Center

Just like in drawing a circle, we draw an ellipse by first identifying its **center**.
For an equation of standard form above, the center has coordinates $(h,k)$.

### Vertices

We then locate the **vertices**, the four points furthest from the center horizontally and vertically.
The two vertices on the left and right are $a$ units from the center, so their coordinates are $(h-a, k)$
and $(h+a, k)$.

Meanwhile, the two vertices on the top and bottom are $b$ units from the center, so their coordinates are
$(h, k-b)$ and $(h, k+b)$.

Marking out these points then allow us to draw the ellipse.

## Example

The following is a sketch of the ellipse with equation

$$ \frac{(x+2)^2}{4} + \frac{(y-5)^2}{9} = 1 $$
