## Equations of hyperbolas

_Horizontal_ and _vertical_ hyperbolas have
the following equations in standard form

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{Horizontal hyperbola:} \quad && \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\
&\text{Vertical hyperbola:} \quad && \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} = 1
\end{align*}
$$

## Key features of hyperbolas

The diagram above shows the key features of hyperbolas. In particular, the following features
are most useful in drawing hyperbolas:

- center
- vertices
- asymptotes

## Drawing a hyperbola

### Center

Just like in drawing an ellipse, we draw a hyperbola by first identifying its **center**.
For an equation of standard form above, the center has coordinates $(h,k)$.

### Horizontal vs vertical hyperbolas

We then deduce whether our hyperbola is **horizontal** or **vertical**, based on its equation (does $x$
or $y$ appear first in the difference in our equation?).

### Vertices

We then locate the **vertices**. For a horizontal hyperbola, the two vertices
are $a$ units on the left and right of the center, with coordinates $(h-a, k)$ and $(h+a, k)$.

For a vertical hyperbola, the two vertices are $b$ units above and below the center, with coordinates
$(h, k-b)$ and $(h, k+b)$.

### Asymptotes

For both horizontal and vertical hyperbolas, there are two oblique **asymptotes** that pass through the
center. They have gradient $\pm \frac{b}{a}$ so their equations are

- $y - k = \frac{b}{a}(x + h)$
- $y - k = - \frac{b}{a}(x + h)$

With these features set up on our graph, we can then proceed to draw our hyperbolas. We start off at one corner
of an asymptote, bend towards and pass through the vertex and then go back towards the other asymptote.

We draw to the left and right of the center for,horizontal hyperbolas. For
vertical hyperbolas, we draw
above and below the center.

## Example 1

The following is a sketch of the vertical hyperbola with equation

$$ \frac{y^2}{64} - \frac{x^2}{36} = 1 $$

The origin is the center of the hyperbola, with vertices $(0, 8)$ and $(0, -8)$.

The gradient of the asymptotes are ${\pm\frac{8}{6}=\pm\frac{4}{3}}$
so the equations of the asymptotes are ${y=\pm\frac{4}{3}x}$.

## Example 2

The following is a sketch of the horizontal hyperbola with equation

$$ \frac{(x-2)^2}{36} + \frac{(y+5)^2}{81} = 1 $$

The center of the hyperbola is $(2,-5)$, and it has vertices $6$ units horizontally from the center
so their coordinates are $(-4, -5)$ and $(8, 5)$.

The gradient of the asymptotes are ${\pm\frac{9}{6}=\pm\frac{3}{2}}$
so the equations of the asymptotes are ${y+5=\pm\frac{3}{2}(x-2)}$.
