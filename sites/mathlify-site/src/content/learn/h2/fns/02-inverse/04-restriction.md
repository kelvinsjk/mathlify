We have seen that $`f(x)=x^2` with domain $`(-\infty, \infty)` does not have an
inverse function because it is not one-to-one.

However, we can choose a subset of the domain of $`f` such that the function is
one-to-one. This subset is called a **restricted domain**.

For example, we can define new functions $`g` and $`h` such that they both share
the same rule as $`f` but have smaller domains. Each of them is one-to-one and
has an inverse.

$$`\begin{align*} &g:x \mapsto x^2, \quad && x\in\mathbb{R},x\geq 0, \\ &h:x \mapsto x^2, \quad && x\in\mathbb{R},x \leq 0. \end{align*}`$$
